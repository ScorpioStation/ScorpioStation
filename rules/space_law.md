# Space Law
Space Law is the name given to the set of corporate regulations approved by the ArkSoft Board of Directors for use on their Space Stations.

Space Law applies to all Ark employees and authorized visitors of the station. Anyone aboard the station legally is both protected by, and expected to follow, Space Law. Any individuals that forcefully board the station are not protected by Space Law.

Central Command can authorize pardons for crimes as they see fit.

Great cases of Role-Playing may excuse certain crimes. Ask the Admins if you wish to intentionally break a law. Just remember, you may get fired if you can't cover it up.

## Interpretation of the Law
In order to ensure workplace productivity, an operating knowledge of Space Law is important for ArkSoft employees. More in-depth knowledge of Space Law is required for positions such as Magistrate, Internal Affairs Agent, Warden, and Head of Security.

For certain crimes, the intention of the accused is important. The difference between [Murder](#murder-502) and [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401) can be hard to ascertain. When in doubt, you should default to the lesser crime.

**Multiple Counts** - Charging someone with multiple counts of a crime is disallowed. Even if someone steals every toolbox on the station, it is only one count of [Petty Theft](#petty-theft-107).

Knowingly aiding a criminal is [Aiding and Abetting](#aiding-and-abetting). Offenders are to be charged with the same sentence as the person they helped with a minimum charge of five minutes.

### Crime Stacking ###
The rules regarding crime stacking (charging someone with multiple crimes simultaneously) are:

* Crimes with the same last 2 digits in their crime number (e.g: 102/202/302) can never be stacked together.

* Crimes with notes that say they don't stack with another crime, obviously cannot be stacked with that crime.

* Crimes which are very similar (e.g: contraband and drug possession, for the same item) cannot be stacked together. Charge only the most serious crime.

* Otherwise, crimes CAN be stacked together. e.g: you can charge someone with BOTH [Breaking and Entering](#breaking-and-entering-208) AND [Petty Theft](#petty-theft-107) for breaking in and stealing something. The timers are added together.

### Brig Procedures
See Also: Legal Standard Operating Procedure

Special precautions are to be taken aside from Standard Brigging Procedures:

* Ask Vox or Plasmamen prisoners where their Internals Tank is located. **Do not remove this tank, as it will kill them.** In such a case where their clothes have to be changed, **expedience is mandatory.**

* All [Contraband](#contraband) is to be confiscated and placed in Evidence Storage, this includes tools used in a crime. These are **not** to be returned.

* Make routine checks on the Permabrig, Solitary, and Labor Camp areas if they happen to be occupied.

### Legal Representation and Trials
See Also: Legal Standard Operating Procedure

While prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation, **Security is under no obligation to provide or allow it unless otherwise specified by the Magistrate.**

Internal Affairs Agents, and by extension the Magistrate, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the sentencing process. However, Internal Affairs Agents have **zero** authority over the Brig, Security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. Internal Affairs Agents attempting to throw their weight around can, and should be, ignored.

* **Disruptive IAA** - If the IAA is asked to leave the brig by the Magistrate, HoS, Warden or Captain, they must do so, and cannot return until one of those four people allows it. If they return without permission, or are otherwise disruptive, Security may ask the Magistrate for permission to demote them. If no Magistrate is present, the Captain may approve their demotion instead.

* **Sentencing Conflicts** - In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner, the following chain should be followed, in order of authority: Magistrate > Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Officer / Detective.

### Use of Deadly Force
As a member of the station's Security force, you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station and equipped with the latest in non-lethal weaponry.

Situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between. In the vast majority of cases, you will be expected to use your non-lethal tools which are many times more effective than lethal options to defuse a situation.

There are however certain circumstances where deadly force is permissible:

* **Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective** - Targets impervious to non-lethal weapons such as Exosuits, Holo Parasites and their owner, Xenomorphs, Cyborgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile.

* **Severe Personal Risk** - Scenarios in which significant personal risk is present should an arrest be attempted. Changelings, Wizards, situations with multiple hostiles, criminals in hostile environments (space, fire, plasma leaks, etc.), and criminals in possession of high explosives all fall into this category.

* **Armed and Dangerous** - Suspects in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, with reasonable suspicion that they will utilize them. In the majority of cases, it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the Armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous. Maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets.

* **Posthumous Revival** - Should lethal force be levied against a target that is not an *Enemy of the Corporation*, such as a cultist, the person is to be revived and sentenced/deconverted as soon as possible. Petty criminals met with lethal force are to be given immediate medical attention when captured.

In general, if it is possible to capture personnel non-lethally you should. If you do not, expect to have to justify yourself to Internal Affairs to not get fired and to Administrators to not be banned from Security jobs.

### Enemies of the Corporation
Occasionally, you will encounter personnel that are working for an enemy of ArkSoft (such as the Syndicate) and/or are working to undermine ArkSoft's operations.

Current enemies of ArkSoft include but are not limited to: The Syndicate (through secret agents, boarding parties, and brainwashing specialists), the Space Wizards Federation, Changelings, Shadowlings, Vampires, and other intelligent hostile forms of life that seek to cause major damage to the station and or crew.

* **Execution/Imprisonment** - If an Enemy of the Corporation has not committed any *Capital Crimes* they are to be placed in Permanent Imprisonment (Permabrig/Solitary/Labor Camp/Exile) without exception. Otherwise, Execution is permitted at the discretion of the Magistrate. If no Magistrate has been assigned, or is otherwise unable to authorize an execution, the Captain may authorize executions in accordance with *Legal Standard Operating Procedure*.

* **Uncontainable EoCs** - Hatched Shadowlings are to be killed on sight. Powered Vampires, or any other Enemies of the Corporation that cannot be contained safely in the Brig, are to be executed or exiled irrespective of their crimes. Head Revolutionaries are to be executed or exiled as soon as they are positively identified. Being a space-proof species does not constitute being impossible to contain.

* **Changelings/Testimony** - All changelings are to be considered hostile alien lifeforms and a direct threat to all personnel. All changelings are to be killed on sight and immediately cremated. Forensic evidence and/or direct testimony from Mindshielded personnel is necessary to establish proof. Personnel who provide false testimony are to be charged with Murder if the supposed changeling is killed and attempted murder if it is not.

* **Surrendering EoCs** - Enemies of the Corporation that willingly turn themselves into Security of their own accord are to be kept in Permanent Imprisonment so long as they aren't impossible to contain. Defectors and captives are to be transported to Central Command via the Crew Transfer Shuttle; they are to be treated as dangerous enemies, but also protected from retribution and provided for.

* **Parole for EoCs** - Parole can be offered to Enemies of the Corporation at the discretion of the Captain or Magistrate. This should only happen in emergencies where extra hands are desperately needed. Paroled Enemies of the Corporation are to be stripped of all their belongings and given basic Civilian access.

### Additional Clarifications
Executions can be done **only** by:
* Electric Chair
* Lethal Injection
* Firing Squad
* Gas Inhalation
* Asphyxiation

Other means of Execution are illegal unless a prisoner requests them. Cyborgification, either as a means of execution or posthumously, is also a valid option. See *Legal Standard Operating Procedure* for more information regarding executions.

In cases where the final sentence is equal to or greater than 60 minutes, it is to be changed to a Permanent Imprisonment sentence.

The greater good of the station should be considered when sentencing. If someone breaks into the AI Core to destroy a malfunctioning AI there is no need to charge them. Likewise, if the station is under attack by Nuclear Operatives you probably shouldn't be brigging people for trespassing. The intent of Space Law is to protect the station and the crew, not to hinder them.

### Minor Crimes ###
All of these crimes are punishable by a warning or sentence up to 5 minutes at the discretion of Security.

#### Damage to Station Assets (100)
**Definition**: To deliberately damage the station or station property to a minor degree with malicious intent.

**Notes**: *Departmental Pets*, *Cyborgs*, Xenobio golems, and personal pets are station property. Graffiti is not considered Damage to Station Assets, but destruction of personal belongings or property is. For serious damage to station property, see [Sabotage](#sabotage-300).

#### Battery (102)
**Definition**: To use minor physical force against someone without intent to seriously injure them.

**Notes**: Repeated attempts at disarming (more than 3), tabling, non-lethal chokeholds, minor punching (less than four), smashing bottles on heads, and stunning are all considered battery. For serious harm, see [Assault](#assault-202).

#### Drug Possession (103)
**Definition**: To possess space drugs, ambrosia, krokodil, crank, meth, aranesp, bath salts, THC, or other narcotics, by unauthorized personnel.

**Notes**: Botanists and MedSci staff are not subject to this law so long as they are not distributing or using them for profit or recreation. For distribution, see [Narcotics Distribution](#narcotics-distribution-203).

#### Indecent Exposure (105)
**Definition**: To be intentionally and publicly unclothed.

**Notes**: Running around the station naked or otherwise unclothed.

#### Abuse of Equipment (106)
**Definition**: To utilize security/non-lethal equipment in an illegitimate fashion.

#### Petty Theft (107)
**Definition**: To take items from areas one lacks access to, or to take items belonging to others or the station as a whole.

**Notes**: Keeping items which are in short supply where they belong is what is important here. A doctor who takes all the surgical tools and hides them is guilty of Petty Theft. Resisting demotion is considered Petty Theft. For more serious cases, see [Robbery](#robbery-207) or [Theft](#theft-307).

#### Trespass (108)
**Definition**: To be in an area which a person lacks authorized ID access for. This counts for general areas of the station.

**Notes**: Remember that people can break in, sneak in, or be let in. Always check that the suspect wasn't let in, or was otherwise given access. Trespass and [Theft](#theft-307) are often committed together; both sentences should be applied. For restricted areas, see [Major Trespass](#major-trespass-308).

#### Resisting Arrest (109)
**Definition**: To resist an officer who attempts a proper arrest or search.

**Notes**: Personnel that have been illegitimately arrested cannot be charged with this law. Screaming over comms is not Resisting Arrest. The person must be actively attempting to either run away, or attack the arresting officer.

### Medium Crimes ###
All of these crimes are punishable by a sentence of 5 to 10 minutes at the discretion of Security.

#### Creating a Workplace Hazard (200)
**Definition**: To endanger the crew or station through negligent but not deliberately malicious actions.

**Notes**: Examples of this crime involve accidental plasma leaks, slipping hazards, accidentally shocking doors, breaking windows to space, or Security personnel not keeping their equipment secure. A banana peel in the corridor is not a hazard. A banana peel in front of the singularity is. For Workplace Hazards that lead to death, see [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401). Failure to follow legal security orders during Code Red may constitute Creating a Workplace Hazard.

#### Kidnapping (201)
**Definition**: To hold a crewmember under duress or against their will.

**Notes**: Physical harm is not required for this law to apply: the crewmember must kept in, or forcefully relocated to, a location against their will and be prevented from leaving. Cuffing/Restraining any personnel against their will, outside of legal arrests, qualifies as Kidnapping. For kidnapping of Command/Security see [Kidnapping of an Officer](#kidnapping-of-an-officer-301).

#### Assault (202)
**Definition**: To use excessive physical force against someone without the apparent intent to kill them.

**Notes**: To cause serious but non-critical harm to another crewmember including, but not limited to, forcible/deceptive ingestion of toxic or illicit substances. For life-threatening harm, see [Aggravated Assault](#aggravated-assault-302).

#### Narcotics Distribution (203)
**Definition**: To distribute narcotics and other controlled substances. This includes ambrosia and space drugs. It is not illegal for them to be grown.

**Notes**: Forcing or tricking someone to consume illicit or harmful substances, such as space drugs, is [Assault](#assault-202). For non-distributed drugs used for recreation, see [Drug Possession](#drug-possession-103).

#### Possession of a Weapon (204)
**Definition**: To be in possession of a dangerous item that is not part of one's job.

**Notes**: Items capable of a high level of damage such as saws, axes, spears, stunprods, and hatchets fit into this category. If the item is part of someone's assigned duties they are permitted to carry it. For restricted weapons, see [Possession of a Restricted Weapon](#possession-of-a-restricted-weapon-304).

#### Rioting (205)
**Definition**: To partake in an unauthorized and disruptive assembly of crewmen.

**Notes**: It is required to order the crowd to disperse; failure to disperse is the crime, not the assembly itself. Crimes committed during the riot are considered separate offenses. For the ringleader of a riot, see [Inciting a Riot](#inciting-a-riot-305).

#### Abuse of Confiscated Equipment (206)
**Definition**: To take and use equipment confiscated as evidence.

**Notes**: Evidence is not to be used for anything but evidence with the exception of the Syndicate Encryption Key. Anything used in a crime is considered evidence, this includes everything from tools, to guns, to emags. For general abuse of security equipment, see [Abuse of Equipment](#abuse-of-equipment-106).

#### Robbery (207)
**Definition**: To steal items from another's person.

**Notes**: Remember to return the stolen items to the lawful owner. Stealing an ID is the most common and serious form of robbery. For robbery of more valuable items, see [Theft](#theft-307) or [Grand Theft](#grand-theft-407).

#### Breaking and Entering (208)
**Definition**: Forced entry to areas where the subject does not have access to. This counts for general areas.

**Notes**: Actual entry needs to occur for this law to apply. Damage to external surfaces without entry is to be considered [Damage to Station Assets](#damage-to-station-assets-100). Does not stack with [Damage to Station Assets](#damage-to-station-assets-100) unless damages also occurred after entry. For secure areas, see [Major Trespass](#major-trespass-308).

### Major Crimes ###
All of these crimes are punishable by a sentence of 10 to 15 minutes at the discretion of Security.

#### Sabotage (300)
**Definition**: To hinder the work of the crew or station through malicious actions.

**Notes**: Deliberately releasing N2O, bolting doors, disabling power for a small area of the station, destroying cyborgs, and constructing barricades are all examples of sabotage. For more violent forms, see [Grand Sabotage](#grand-sabotage-400).

#### Kidnapping of an Officer (301)
**Definition**: To hold a member of Command, Security, or any Central Command VIP under duress or against their will.

**Notes**: Physical harm is not required for this law to apply: the crewmember must kept in, or forcefully relocated to, a location against their will and be prevented from leaving. Cuffing/Restraining any personnel against their will, outside of legal arrests, qualifies as Kidnapping of an Officer. For kidnapping of non-Command/Security, see [Kidnapping](#kidnapping-201).

#### Aggravated Assault (302)
**Definition**: To use excessive physical force resulting in severe or life-threatening harm.

**Notes**: Breaking bones, disfiguring, causing internal bleeding, or otherwise putting someone into a critical state. If the victim dies as a result of their injuries, see [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401) or [Murder](#murder-502).

**Definition**: To be in possession of a restricted weapon without authorization such as: Guns, Batons, Non-Beneficial Grenades/Explosives, etc.

**Notes**: Any item that can cause severe bodily harm carried by an unauthorized person. The Bartender is permitted their shotgun and beanbag rounds. The Captain and Head of Security can issue weapon permits. For non-restricted weapons, see [Possession of a Weapon](#possession-of-a-weapon-204). For detonation of explosives, see [Sabotage](#sabotage-300) or [Grand Sabotage](#grand-sabotage-400).

#### Inciting a Riot (305)
**Definition**: To attempt to stir the crew into a riot.

**Notes**: The offender should also have restrictions placed on their radio traffic and be given a tracking implant. For second offenses or violent uprisings, see [Mutiny](#mutiny-505).

#### Possession of Contraband (306)
**Definition**: To be in the possession of contraband items. Being in possession of S-grade contraband, or committing a major crime with contraband, makes you an [Enemy of the Corporation](#enemy-of-the-corporation).

**Notes**: For information on what items are contraband see [Contraband](#contraband). Contraband items from the Gateway are covered by this law. Personnel turning in contraband to Security of their own volition are exempt from this law.

#### Theft (307)
**Definition**: To steal restricted or dangerous items from either an area or one's person.

**Notes**: Weapons fall into this category, as do valuable items that are in limited supply such as spacesuits, and jetpacks. Breaking open Cargo crates to illegally arm/armor one's self, or cracking/drilling restricted area safes, is theft. For theft of minor valuables, see [Petty Theft](#petty-theft-107).

#### Major Trespass (308)
**Definition**: Being in a restricted area without prior authorization. This includes Security areas, Command areas (including EVA), the Engine Room, Atmos, or Toxins Research.

**Notes**: To enter an area one lacks authorized ID access for through either forcible entry or an existing opening. For non-restricted areas, see [Trespass](#trespass-108).

#### Assault of an Officer (309)
**Definition**: To use excessive physical force against a member of Command or Security without the apparent intent to kill them.

**Notes**: To cause serious but non-life threatening harm to a member of Command or Security. For disarming, grabbing, or stunning an officer during an arrest, see [Resisting Arrest](#resisting-arrest-109). [Battery](#battery-102), [Assault](#assault-202), and [Aggravated Assault](#aggravated-assault-302) do not stack with this charge.

### Exceptional Crimes ###
All of these crimes can result in Permanent Prison Time, Exile, or Permanent Labor Camp Time.
* Only the Magistrate, Captain, Head of Security, and Warden can authorize a Permanent Sentence or Exile.
* If a prisoner requests an Execution or Cyborgization, they may be given one.
* Any prisoners that escape Permanent Imprisonment or Exile may be detained, executed or killed on sight at the discretion of Security.

#### Grand Sabotage (400)
**Definition**: To engage in maliciously destructive actions which endanger the crew or station.

**Notes**: Releasing damaging/lethal viruses, hotwiring the engine, disabling the gravity generator, disabling power for a department or equivalently large portion of the station, subverting or destroying the AI, opening several holes in the station hull, setting fire to large areas, detonating multiple cyborgs, and activating high-yield explosives all count as Grand Sabotage. For lesser acts, see [Sabotage](#sabotage-300). If death was caused, see [Murder](#murder-502).

#### Manslaughter (401)
**Definition**: To cause death to a person via deliberate attack or excessive negligence, without any intent to kill.

**Notes**: Any effort to prevent the resuscitation or cloning of the victim raises this to [Murder](#murder-502). If any evidence of intent exists, see [Murder](#murder-502).

#### Attempted Murder (402)
**Definition**: To use excessive physical force with intention to cause death.

**Notes**: Use of lethal weaponry such as firearms and explosives are considered as intent to murder. If aid was rendered to the victim by the perpetrator afterwards, this may actually be [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401).

#### Grand Theft (407)
**Definition**: To steal items of high value or sensitive nature from either an area or one's person.

**Notes**: Theft of cutting-edge technology, documents, and research samples. Examples include hand teleporters, the Captain/Head of Security's Antique Laser, Captain/HoP level ID cards, mechas, and departmental door remotes. For theft of less important property, see [Petty Theft](#petty-theft-107) or [Theft](#theft-307).

### Capital Crimes ###
All of these crimes can result in Execution, Permanent Prison Time, Permanent Labor Camp Time, Exile or Cyborgization.

* Only the Magistrate, Captain, Head of Security, and Warden can authorize a Permanent Sentence or Exile.
* Only the Magistrate or Captain can authorize an Execution or Forced Cyborgization.
* If a prisoner requests an Execution or Cyborgization, they may be given one.
* Any prisoners that escape Permanent Imprisonment or Exile may be detained, executed or killed on sight at the discretion of Security.
* Any prisoners that escape from an Execution sentence are to be killed on sight.

#### Murder (502)
**Definition**: To deliberately and maliciously cause the death of another crewmember via direct or indirect means.

**Notes**: Any effort to prevent the resuscitation or cloning of the victim is to be considered proof of Murder. Unauthorized executions are also considered Murder. If there is no evidence of intent, see [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401).

#### Mutiny (505)
**Definition**: To act individually, or as a group, to overthrow or subvert the established Chain of Command without lawful and legitimate cause.

**Notes**: Mutiny is not as clear cut as it may seem, there may be a legitimate reason for their actions, such as their head of staff being utterly incompetent. Application of this crime should always be reviewed by a third party. If the perpetrator's actions are for the betterment of ArkSoft, consider a lesser sentence, pardon, or promotion.

### Modifiers and Special Situations ###

#### Aiding and Abetting
**Definition**: To knowingly assist a criminal.

**Notes**: Knowingly assisting a criminal is a crime. This includes but is not limited to: interfering with an arrest, stealing a prisoner in transit, breaking a prisoner out of the brig/prison, hiding a fugitive, and willingly rendering medical aid. If the aided prisoner ends up receiving no charges, apply five minutes to the offender.

**Modifier**: The original criminal's sentence; 5 minute minimum

#### Central Command Directive
**Definition**: To be issued a pardon/sentence modification by Central Command.

**Notes**: Central Command may, under certain circumstances, legally waive sections of Space Law. Irrespective of the original crime, if a pardon or modification to a sentence is issued it is to be followed immediately.

**Modifier**: Immediate Release/Modification

#### Cooperation with Security
**Definition**: Being helpful to the members of security, revealing things during questioning.

**Notes**: Note that the information must be true in order for this modifier to apply. Prisoners giving false information to officers should not be awarded time off.

**Modifier**: 50% reduction

#### Escape from Brig
**Definition**: To flee successfully or unsuccessfully from a lawful sentence.

**Notes**: Repeatedly damaging or otherwise destroying a cell enclosure is considered an escape attempt. Unless the prisoner was attempting to escape from an [immediate threat](#immediate-threat-to-prisoner), reset the timer to the original sentence or add five minutes (whichever is greater).

**Modifier**: Reset Timer or +5 minutes.

#### Hostile Brainwashing
**Definition**: To be under the mind control of a Cult, Shadowling, or other mind-controlling circumstances.

**Notes**: Any brainwashed person is to be detained non-lethally and deconverted or dethralled. Deconverted/dethralled persons are to be immediately pardoned of their crimes and released. Any contraband or dangerous items found at the time of deconversion are to be confiscated without punishment.

**Modifier**: Deconversion & Release

#### Immediate Threat to Prisoner
**Definition**: A severe threat to a prisoner's person.

**Notes**: Prisoners are entitled to medical aid if injured or sick. In cases of self-harm, aid may be rendered at the discretion of Security. The timer continues to run during this time.

**Modifier**: Running Timer

#### Parole
**Definition**: To be released, under parole, before the allotted sentence for a crime is up.

**Notes**: For non-Capital Crimes, Parole may be offered at the discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, Captain or Magistrate. For Capital Crimes, see [Enemy of the Corporation](#enemy-of-the-corporation). Parolees are to be kept under surveillance and, should they commit another crime, be charged with it on top of their original sentence. Breaking parole disqualifies any chance of future parole. Prisoners breaking parole from Capital Crimes are to be executed upon capture.

**Modifier**: Parole Until Release

#### Refusal to Cooperate
**Definition**: Non-cooperative behavior/repeated attempts to escape.

**Notes**: While already detained inside the brig and awaiting a sentence, acting in a manner which makes security waste time processing you. Attempting to resist/fleeing from processing or imprisonment is refusal to cooperate. This modifier can result in Permanent Imprisonment if it brings the sentence above 60 minutes.

**Modifier**: 50% addition

#### Repeat Offender
**Definition**: To be brigged for the same offense more than twice.

**Notes**: Offenses must not be committed as part of one crime spree, and must be separate repeat offenses. Upon the third sentencing for the same crime, five minutes is to be added. An additional five minutes is to be added for every successive imprisonment. After three applications of this modifier (on their fifth same-crime offense), the perpetrator is to be permabrigged.

**Modifier**: 5 minute cumulative addition on 3rd offense. Permabrig on 5th offense.

#### Self Defense
**Definition**: Acting to protect one's self, coworkers, or workplace.

**Notes**: Persons intentionally getting involved in fights which occur in a department that isn't theirs is an act of vigilantism, not self-defense. Self-defense typically involves attempts to disarm or disengage, beating someone while they're down should be considered [Assault](#assault-202) unless the defender's life was in danger.

**Modifier**: Immediate Release

#### Surrender
**Definition**: Willfully surrendering to Security.

**Notes**: Coming to the brig, confessing what you've done, and taking the punishment. Getting arrested without a fuss is not surrender.

**Modifier**: 50% reduction

### Contraband
* It is the duty of crew to turn in C or S grade Contraband when found. Failure to turn in Contraband will result in charges.

#### Non-Contraband (NC)
Non-Contraband items. The [Contraband](#possession-of-contraband-306) charge does not apply to any of these items. They may not be confiscated unless directly used in the commission of a crime.

#### Standard Contraband (C)
These items are to be confiscated and the owner is to be charged for [Contraband](#possession-of-contraband-306). If used in committing a non-contraband related [[#Major Crimes|Major Crime]], the owner is to be charged as an [Enemy of the Corporation](#enemy-of-the-corporation). The amount or variety of C-grade Contraband is irrelevant to the charge, it only applies once.

#### Dangerous Contraband (S)
