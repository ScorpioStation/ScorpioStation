# Space Law
Space Law is the name given to the set of corporate regulations approved by the ArkSoft Board of Directors for use on their Space Stations.

Space Law applies to all Ark employees and authorized visitors of the station. Anyone aboard the station legally is both protected by, and expected to follow, Space Law. Any individuals that forcefully board the station are not protected by Space Law.

Central Command can authorize pardons for crimes as they see fit.

Great cases of Role-Playing may excuse certain crimes. Ask the Admins if you wish to intentionally break a law. Just remember, you may get fired if you can't cover it up.

## Interpretation of the Law
In order to ensure workplace productivity, an operating knowledge of Space Law is important for ArkSoft employees. More in-depth knowledge of Space Law is required for positions such as Magistrate, Internal Affairs Agent, Warden, and Head of Security.

For certain crimes, the intention of the accused is important. The difference between [Murder](#murder-502) and [Manslaughter](#manslaughter-401) can be hard to ascertain. When in doubt, you should default to the lesser crime.

**Multiple Counts** - Charging someone with multiple counts of a crime is disallowed. Even if someone steals every toolbox on the station, it is only one count of **Petty Theft (107)**.

Knowingly aiding a criminal is **Aiding and Abetting**. Offenders are to be charged with the same sentence as the person they helped with a minimum charge of five minutes.

### Crime Stacking ###
The rules regarding crime stacking (charging someone with multiple crimes simultaneously) are:

* Crimes with the same last 2 digits in their crime number (e.g: 102/202/302) can never be stacked together.

* Crimes with notes that say they don't stack with another crime, obviously cannot be stacked with that crime.

* Crimes which are very similar (e.g: contraband and drug possession, for the same item) cannot be stacked together. Charge only the most serious crime.

* Otherwise, crimes CAN be stacked together. e.g: you can charge someone with BOTH **Breaking and Entering (208)** AND **Petty Theft (107)** for breaking in and stealing something. The timers are added together.

### Brig Procedures
See Also: Legal Standard Operating Procedure

Special precautions are to be taken aside from Standard Brigging Procedures:

* Ask Vox or Plasmamen prisoners where their Internals Tank is located. **Do not remove this tank, as it will kill them.** In such a case where their clothes have to be changed, **expedience is mandatory.**

* All *Contraband* is to be confiscated and placed in Evidence Storage, this includes tools used in a crime. These are **not** to be returned.

* Make routine checks on the Permabrig, Solitary, and Labor Camp areas if they happen to be occupied.

### Legal Representation and Trials
See Also: Legal Standard Operating Procedure

While prisoners are permitted to seek legal representation, **Security is under no obligation to provide or allow it unless otherwise specified by the Magistrate.**

Internal Affairs Agents, and by extension the Magistrate, exist to serve as a guiding hand and the voice of reason within the sentencing process. However, Internal Affairs Agents have **zero** authority over the Brig, Security personnel, prisoners, or sentencing. Internal Affairs Agents attempting to throw their weight around can, and should be, ignored.

* **Disruptive IAA** - If the IAA is asked to leave the brig by the Magistrate, HoS, Warden or Captain, they must do so, and cannot return until one of those four people allows it. If they return without permission, or are otherwise disruptive, Security may ask the Magistrate for permission to demote them. If no Magistrate is present, the Captain may approve their demotion instead.

* **Sentencing Conflicts** - In instances where a conflict of opinion arises over the sentence of a prisoner, the following chain should be followed, in order of authority: Magistrate > Captain > Head of Security > Warden > Officer / Detective.

### Use of Deadly Force
As a member of the station's Security force, you are one of the best armed and protected people on the station and equipped with the latest in non-lethal weaponry.

Situations that warrant the use of Deadly Force are few and far between. In the vast majority of cases, you will be expected to use your non-lethal tools which are many times more effective than lethal options to defuse a situation.

There are however certain circumstances where deadly force is permissible:

* **Non-Lethal Weapons Ineffective** - Targets impervious to non-lethal weapons such as Exosuits, Holo Parasites and their owner, Xenomorphs, Cyborgs, and Hulks. Lethal force may be used against these targets if they prove hostile.

* **Severe Personal Risk** - Scenarios in which significant personal risk is present should an arrest be attempted. Changelings, Wizards, situations with multiple hostiles, criminals in hostile environments (space, fire, plasma leaks, etc.), and criminals in possession of high explosives all fall into this category.

* **Armed and Dangerous** - Suspects in possession of weapons, including stun weapons, with reasonable suspicion that they will utilize them. In the majority of cases, it is still preferable to attempt to detain them non-lethally. Unauthorized personnel in the Armory are considered by default to be Armed and Dangerous. Maximum force is permitted to subdue such targets.

* **Posthumous Revival** - Should lethal force be levied against a target that is not an *Enemy of the Corporation*, such as a cultist, the person is to be revived and sentenced/deconverted as soon as possible. Petty criminals met with lethal force are to be given immediate medical attention when captured.

In general, if it is possible to capture personnel non-lethally you should. If you do not, expect to have to justify yourself to Internal Affairs to not get fired and to Administrators to not be banned from Security jobs.

### Enemies of the Corporation
Occasionally, you will encounter personnel that are working for an enemy of ArkSoft (such as the Syndicate) and/or are working to undermine ArkSoft's operations.

Current enemies of ArkSoft include but are not limited to: The Syndicate (through secret agents, boarding parties, and brainwashing specialists), the Space Wizards Federation, Changelings, Shadowlings, Vampires, and other intelligent hostile forms of life that seek to cause major damage to the station and or crew.

* **Execution/Imprisonment** - If an Enemy of the Corporation has not committed any *Capital Crimes* they are to be placed in Permanent Imprisonment (Permabrig/Solitary/Labor Camp/Exile) without exception. Otherwise, Execution is permitted at the discretion of the Magistrate. If no Magistrate has been assigned, or is otherwise unable to authorize an execution, the Captain may authorize executions in accordance with *Legal Standard Operating Procedure*.

* **Uncontainable EoCs** - Hatched Shadowlings are to be killed on sight. Powered Vampires, or any other Enemies of the Corporation that cannot be contained safely in the Brig, are to be executed or exiled irrespective of their crimes. Head Revolutionaries are to be executed or exiled as soon as they are positively identified. Being a space-proof species does not constitute being impossible to contain.

* **Changelings/Testimony** - All changelings are to be considered hostile alien lifeforms and a direct threat to all personnel. All changelings are to be killed on sight and immediately cremated. Forensic evidence and/or direct testimony from Mindshielded personnel is necessary to establish proof. Personnel who provide false testimony are to be charged with Murder if the supposed changeling is killed and attempted murder if it is not.

* **Surrendering EoCs** - Enemies of the Corporation that willingly turn themselves into Security of their own accord are to be kept in Permanent Imprisonment so long as they aren't impossible to contain. Defectors and captives are to be transported to Central Command via the Crew Transfer Shuttle; they are to be treated as dangerous enemies, but also protected from retribution and provided for.

* **Parole for EoCs** - Parole can be offered to Enemies of the Corporation at the discretion of the Captain or Magistrate. This should only happen in emergencies where extra hands are desperately needed. Paroled Enemies of the Corporation are to be stripped of all their belongings and given basic Civilian access.

### Additional Clarifications
Executions can be done **only** by:
* Electric Chair
* Lethal Injection
* Firing Squad
* Gas Inhalation
* Asphyxiation

Other means of Execution are illegal unless a prisoner requests them. Cyborgification, either as a means of execution or posthumously, is also a valid option. See *Legal Standard Operating Procedure* for more information regarding executions.

In cases where the final sentence is equal to or greater than 60 minutes, it is to be changed to a Permanent Imprisonment sentence.

The greater good of the station should be considered when sentencing. If someone breaks into the AI Core to destroy a malfunctioning AI there is no need to charge them. Likewise, if the station is under attack by Nuclear Operatives you probably shouldn't be brigging people for trespassing. The intent of Space Law is to protect the station and the crew, not to hinder them.

|**Murder**
| To deliberately and maliciously cause the death of another crewmember via direct or indirect means.
| Any effort to prevent the resuscitation or cloning of the victim is to be considered proof of Murder. Unauthorised executions are also considered Murder. If there is no evidence of intent, see [[#Manslaughter|Manslaughter]].

! 505
|[[File:SL_Mutiny.png]]{{anchor|Mutiny}}
|**Mutiny**
| To act individually, or as a group, to overthrow or subvert the established Chain of Command without lawful and legitimate cause.
| Mutiny is not as clear cut as it may seem, there may be a legitimate reason for their actions, such as their head of staff being utterly incompetent. Application of this crime should always be reviewed by a third party. If the perpetrator's actions are for the betterment of ArkSoft, consider a lesser sentence, pardon, or promotion.

|                      | Notes
| style="width: 14em;" | Modifier
|-
!**Aiding and Abetting**
| To knowingly assist a criminal.
| Knowingly assisting a criminal is a crime. This includes but is not limited to: interfering with an arrest, stealing a prisoner in transit, breaking a prisoner out of the brig/prison, hiding a fugitive, and willingly rendering medical aid. If the aided prisoner ends up receiving no charges, apply five minutes to the offender. {{anchor|Central Command Directive}}
| The original criminal's sentence; 5 minute minimum
|-
!**Central Command Directive**
| To be issued a pardon/sentence modification by Central Command.
| Central Command may, under certain circumstances, legally waive sections of Space Law. Irrespective of the original crime, if a pardon or modification to a sentence is issued it is to be followed immediately. {{anchor|Cooperation with Security}}
| Immediate Release/Modification
|-
!**Cooperation with Security**
| Being helpful to the members of security, revealing things during questioning.
| Note that the information must be true in order for this modifier to apply. Prisoners giving false information to officers should not be awarded time off. {{anchor|Escape from Brig}}
| 50% reduction
|-
!**Escape from Brig**
| To flee successfully or unsuccessfully from a lawful sentence.
| Repeatedly damaging or otherwise destroying a cell enclosure is considered an escape attempt. Unless the prisoner was attempting to escape from an [[#Immediate Threat to Prisoner|immediate threat]], reset the timer to the original sentence or add five minutes (whichever is greater). {{anchor|Hostile Brainwashing}}
| Reset Timer or +5 minutes.
|-
!**Hostile Brainwashing**
| To be under the mind control of a Cult, Shadowling, or other mind-controlling circumstances.
| Any brainwashed person is to be detained non-lethally and deconverted or dethralled. Deconverted/dethralled persons are to be immediately pardoned of their crimes and released. Any contraband or dangerous items found at the time of deconversion are to be confiscated without punishment. {{anchor|Immediate Threat to Prisoner}}
| Deconversion & Release
|-
!**Immediate Threat to Prisoner**
| A severe threat to a prisoner's person.
| The singularity eats something near the brig, an explosion goes off, etc. Officer must relocate the prisoner(s) to a safe location or otherwise immediately release them. {{anchor|Medical Attention}}
| Immediate Release/Relocation
|-
!**Medical Attention**
| A sick or injured prisoner requires medical aid.
| Prisoners are entitled to medical aid if injured or sick. In cases of self-harm, aid may be rendered at the discretion of Security. The timer continues to run during this time. {{anchor|Parole}}
| Running Timer
|-
!**Parole**
| To be released, under parole, before the allotted sentence for a crime is up.
| For non-Capital Crimes, Parole may be offered at the discretion of the Warden, Head of Security, Captain or Magistrate. For Capital Crimes, see [[#Enemies of the Corporation|Enemy of the Corporation]]. Parolees are to be kept under surveillance and, should they commit another crime, be charged with it on top of their original sentence. Breaking parole disqualifies any chance of future parole. Prisoners breaking parole from Capital Crimes are to be executed upon capture. {{anchor|Refusal to Cooperate}}
| Parole Until Release
|-
!**Refusal to Cooperate**
| Non-cooperative behaviour/repeated attempts to escape.
| While already detained inside the brig and awaiting a sentence, acting in a manner which makes security waste time processing you. Attempting to resist/fleeing from processing or imprisonment is refusal to cooperate. This modifier can result in Permanent Imprisonment if it brings the sentence above 60 minutes. {{anchor|Repeat Offender}}
| 50% addition
|-
!**Repeat Offender**
| To be brigged for the same offense more than twice.
| Offenses must not be committed as part of one crime spree, and must be separate repeat offenses. Upon the third sentencing for the same crime, five minutes is to be added. An additional five minutes is to be added for every successive imprisonment. After three applications of this modifier (on their fifth same-crime offense), the perpetrator is to be permabrigged. {{anchor|Self Defense}}
| 5 minute cumulative addition on 3rd offense.
Permabrig on 5th offense.
|-
!**Self Defense**
| Acting to protect one's self, coworkers, or workplace.
| Persons intentionally getting involved in fights which occur in a department that isn't theirs is an act of vigilantism, not self-defense. Self-defense typically involves attempts to disarm or disengage, beating someone while they're down should be considered [[#Assault|Assault]] unless the defender's life was in danger. {{anchor|Surrender}}
| Immediate Release
|-
!**Surrender**
| Willfully surrendering to Security.
| Coming to the brig, confessing what you've done, and taking the punishment. Getting arrested without a fuss is not surrender.
| 50% reduction
|}
