## Quick Troubleshooting
~If the code doesn't build, did you forget to run `prepare-dev-windows.bat`?
You can double-click the script from the GUI. No command line required.~  

`prepare-dev-windows.bat` references online resources that are no longer
available. You'll need to build the resources for yourself or extract them
from a Docker image (see `prepare-dev-linux.sh`)
